<dl>
<dt class="ghosties"> The Ghosty Kind</dt> <strong>Previous Life experience!</strong>
<dd>While commonly misunderstood, ghosties have an innocent playful nature. They're often found playing with dolls, singing classic nursey rhymes, and love to play hide and seek. They're often found playing in empty school yards, sewer drains, and the woods near camp grounds.  </dd>

<dt class="fae">The Wild Fae</dt>
<dd>The Fae are smaller, magical creatures with a knack for fun! They enjoy playing together forever and appreciate trickets and the art of gift giving to a radical extent. With a Fae friend you will never be bored! They're often found near fairy circles (which are portals to their world!) and prefer the woods. Be sure to treat your Fae nicley and never give them your real name in order to continue living your best life together.  </dd>

<dt class="pantemime">The Pantemime Kind</dt> <strong>Love to Role Play!</strong>
<dd>The classic! Pantemime friends are the easiest to find and love to play pretend! They will attend every tea party, every home hosted fashion show, and every birthday party. They can be found lurking in dreams, hidding in the backround of mirrors, and can be heard taking naps in TV static.</dd>
