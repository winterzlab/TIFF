<dt class="q1"> What do you feed them? </dt>
<dd>ghosties often feed on emotion, the happier you are, the happier they are! Fae prefer to be given trinkets, thye forge on their own. Pnatemimers enjoy empty tea sets, fictional finger foods, and cheese. </dd>

<dt class="q2">How long do they live?</dt>
<dd> Your ghosties will outlive you, the Fae keep your own personal life expectancy spicy, and pantemimes stick around until you forget about them, then they go to the next person who needs them! </dd>

<dt class="q3">Am I in danger?</dt>
<dd>Not necessarily, just like personal human relations, it is completley up to you and how you treat your friends. Results may vary, but you should be fine.</dd>
